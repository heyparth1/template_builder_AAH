Simon & Kaz'

Annual Update.

Your Agenda.

7. What would you like to get out of this meeting?

Kaz has mentioned on several occasions about wanting to finish work at the end of the tax year; so we would really like to see if that is feasible, which we think it is, but more importantly what does that do to the overall income drawdown?

Also we would like to get your help with spending £65K on a motorhome when we both finally finish work and where that money best come from and again what that does to the overall financial position.

2. What changes have there been in your personal or financial circumstances?

Retirement Plans - please provide a high-level update on your retirement plans/any change since our last meeting

FYI we are looking at three scenarios

Both finish work tax year end April 24 (presume you mean Apr '24 - end of tax year 23/24, as opposed to Apr'23, end of tax year 24/25?) We mean end of tax year April 24

Kaz finish tax year end 24 and I stay as is

Kaz drops to 2 days a week and I stay as is (how many days is Kaz working now?) Kaz is working 3 days a week

Boots Pension - have you received a 'retirement claim' pack for your Boots pension? Please provide a copy if you have. No haven't received but have phoned and said urgent

Kaz Payslip - please provide a recent payslip for Kaz.

Cash Savings - are you adding to these or using them up? Using them up, to pay Simon's tax and holidays

Big Expenses - do you have any new big expenses coming up, that we are not already aware of? As mentioned the £65K motorhome in the medium term

Other - ...? None

3. What are your financial concerns or worries?

1. The world economy not improving in time for it to correct the circa £65K loss in the value of our pot.

2. Giving up work and finding our pot doesn't deliver the income we need to enjoy the lifestyle we have wished for

3. Conversely leaving full retirement too long and suffering illness or death and not enjoying it
